### Exercise 1
---

This diagram below is a good solution as it allows there to be multiple Toy- Descriptions made off the one Toy. This allows for multilpe descriptions of the one Toy rather than creating an entirely differnt entity for each toy. The data from say a RaceCar's engine size can be entered into the description, and then another description table being created to say whether it uses petrol or diseal.

It is is memory efficent as it's reuseing the same entity.

Same priniple applies for access time.
